# Pong Game

This is a simple Pong game built using Python 3.11, Turtle and winsound libraries. <br><br>

## Installation<br>
To run the game, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)<br>

You'll also need to import the Turtle and windsound libraries as shown below:<br>

### For Windows users:
```python
import turtle
import winsound
```
For those using **MACOS** and **Linux** you import:

```python
import os
```
And how you invoke the method within your code is as below:

### For MAC users
```python
os.system("afplay sound_Name.wav&")
```

### For Linux users
```python
os.system("aplay sound_Name.wav&")
```

## How to Play<br>
The game is a two-player game. Each player controls a paddle on opposite sides of the screen, and the goal is to hit the ball past the other player's paddle.<br><br>

**Player A** controls their paddle with the **_W_** and **_Z_** keys.<br>
**Player B** controls their paddle with the **_O_** and **_M_** keys.<br>
The game never ends.ðŸ˜®<br><br>
